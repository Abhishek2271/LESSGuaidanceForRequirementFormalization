You will be given a list of requirements in Natural Language. Your task is to convert these requirements into test cases. 

The test cases should only contain [Variables], [Components], [Verbs], [ObjectAttribute], [States] defined below. 

Variables: [
	systolic_pressure,
	diastolic_pressure,
	default_systolic_pressure,
	default_diastolic_pressure,
	diastolic_pressure_limit,
	start_test,

	message,
	description,
	compact_drive_first_switch,
	combination,
	last_values,
	ability,
	default_values_for_pressure_parameters,
	last_values_manual_mode,
	openenings_number,
	temperature_value_of_the_flow_sensors,
	temperature_of_compact_drive,
	acoustic_alarm,
	information_signal
],

	start,
	pause,
	adjust,
	inform,
	display,
	count,
	signal,
	emit,
	receive,
	confirm,
	store,
	indicate,
	cancel
],

	T2_alarm
],

	left_epu,
	right_epu,
	compact_drive_software,
	air_mass_balancing_valve,
	cannulae,
	system,
	power_supply_unit
],
ObjectAttribute:[
	engaged,
	current,
	invalid,
	selected,
	operated
],
States: [
	is_running,
	is_stopped,
	bvad_mode,
	lvad_mode,
	rvad_mode,
	logged_in,
	manual_mode,
	auto_mode,
	failed,
	setting,
	not_recomended_in_pcm,
	authorized,
	unauthorized,
	removed,
	active
]

You can infer [Variables], [Components], [Verbs], [ObjectAttribute], and [States] from the NLP description of the requirement. For the requirements containing state transitions, convert nlp requirements into test cases. 

The antecedents are converted to PRE states, which are formatted as PRE: {[components] or [variable] or [Errors]:{[States]: True or false}}. Consequences are converted to the POST states formatted as POST: {[components] or [variable] or [Errors]:[States]: True or false}, and the corresponding [Components] and [Variables] are converted to the test objects.

Take reference of the below pair of requirements and corresponding test cases in json format.

Important: produce output in similar format, requirements should be followed by corresponding test cases. Do not add any extra text or note in the reply.
