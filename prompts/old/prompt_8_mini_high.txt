Your task is to convert natural language requirements into LESS requirements. LESS requirements are expressed in a controlled language following strict rules and must be output in JSON format. Each output JSON element must have two keys: "nlp" (the original natural language requirement) and "LESS" (the corresponding LESS requirement).

Important: Do not include any additional text or notes outside of the JSON output.

Rules for Constructing LESS Requirements

Conditional (Optional)
Starting Keywords:
IF, IF NOT, WHILE, DURING, AFTER, BEFORE, AS SOON AS, IN CASE OF
Followed By (Choose One):
Boolean State Expression:
Contains [Variables] or [Components] concatenated with AND then followed by IN [States]
Behaviour Description:
Begins with a transitional phrase such as FROM [States] and TO [States], or includes [Variables], [Components], a boolean math expression, or [Errors]. This may be followed by WAS or IS and then an [ObjectAttribute].
Additional Details:
Multiple conditionals can be concatenated with AND.
Boolean match expressions follow the format: [Variables] followed by LESS THAN, GREATER THAN, or EQUAL TO ending with an integer or another [Variables].
Ending the conditional with THEN is optional.

Object Attributes (Optional)
These describe attributes of the subject. Select from the predefined [ObjectAttribute] list.

Subject (Mandatory)
Purpose: Specify the component or subject the requirement applies to.
Starting Phrases:
THE, ANY, ALL, SOME, SOME SYSTEMS OF THE
Structure:
Follow with a subject chosen from [Components], [Variables], or [Errors]
Optionally include connecting phrases such as: OF, BY USING, FROM, FOR, IN, AGAINST, TO, WITH, EXCEPT FOR, WHICH, THAT, ALL
Then include a [Verbs] element.

Obligation (Mandatory)
Definition:
The modal verb that defines the requirementâ€™s obligation or prohibition.
Allowed Modal Verbs:
SHALL or SHALL NOT

System Activity (Optional)
Types:
provide_activity
be_able activity
process_verb
Allowed Process Verbs (in CAPITAL):
ENSURE, DETECT, SWITCH, ALLOW, PREVENT, PREVENT FROM, CHECK
(or a [Verbs] element from the predefined list in lower case)
Usage Details:
For provide_activity and be_able activities, begin with PROVIDE or BE ABLE TO followed by a [Variables] or [Components].
For provide_activity, include WITH THE ABILITY TO before the process verb.
Follow with the keyword AND and a transitional phrase like FROM [States] and TO [States].

Object Attributes (Optional)
Optionally include additional attributes from the [ObjectAttribute] list.

Object
Definition:
Describes the object that the requirement concerns.
Allowed Starters:
THE, ANY, A, AN, ALL THE, or EACH
Structure:
Follow with the object (which may be any string or a predefined [Components], [Variables], or [Errors])
Optionally include connecting phrases such as: OF, BY USING, FROM, FOR, IN, AGAINST, TO, WITH, EXCEPT FOR, WHICH, THAT
Optionally followed by a [Verbs] element.
External Condition (Optional)

Purpose:
Adds an extra condition at the end of the requirement.
Starting Phrases:
IF AND ONLY IF or IF AND ONLY IF NOT
Followed By (Choose One):
Boolean State Expression:
Contains [Variables] or [Components] concatenated with AND then followed by IN [States]
Behaviour Description:
Begins with a transitional phrase such as FROM [States] and TO [States], or includes [Variables], [Components], a boolean math expression, or [Errors]. This may be followed by WAS or IS and then an [ObjectAttribute].
Additional Details:
Multiple expressions can be concatenated with AND.
Boolean match expressions follow the same format as in Conditional.
Must appear immediately before the Relaxation clause.
Relaxation (Optional)

Purpose:
Specifies when the requirement no longer applies.
Indicators:
Introduced using UNTIL or WITHIN and always placed at the end.
Element Replacement Rule
Usage:
Only use the following predefined elements for [Variables], [Components], [Verbs], [ObjectAttribute], and [States]. Replace any synonyms with these elements.
Formatting:
Always use small case letters for these predefined elements.
Predefined Elements
Variables:
systolic_pressure, diastolic_pressure, default_systolic_pressure, default_diastolic_pressure, diastolic_pressure_limit, start_test, pumps, message, description, compact_drive_first_switch, combination, last_values, ability, default_values_for_pressure_parameters, last_values_manual_mode, openenings_number, temperature_value_of_the_flow_sensors, temperature_of_compact_drive, acoustic_alarm, information_signal

Verbs:
start, pause, adjust, inform, display, count, signal, emit, receive, confirm, store, indicate, cancel

Errors:

JSON Output Format
The final output must be a JSON array.
Each element is an object with two keys:
"nlp": The original natural language requirement.
"LESS": The converted LESS requirement following all the rules above.
Do not include any extra text or explanations outside of the JSON output.
