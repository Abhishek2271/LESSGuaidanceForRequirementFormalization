        LESS requirements must follow these rules:
        1. Condition (Optional): Specifies when the requirement applies.
            Can start with phrases like: "IF [NOT] THEN", "WHILE", "DURING","AFTER", "BEFORE", "AS SOON AS", "IN CASE OF"
            Multiple conditions can be included in a single requirement.
        2. multiple object attributes that describe attributes of the subject: like engaged, current, invalid
        3. Subject (Mandatory):	The requirement must specify the specific subject it applies to. It can either be a specific subject or a set of component or a variable containing articles like THE, ANY, OF, BY USING, FROM, FOR, IN, AGAINST, TO, WITH, EXCEPT FOR, WHICH, THAT, "ALL or SOME SYSTEMS OF THE" 
        4. obligation (Mandatory): The modal verb defines obligation or prohibition. Only two verbs possible: "SHALL" or "SHALL NOT."
        5. activity: Use these "process verb"s like: "ENSURE", "DETECT", "ALLOW", "SWITCH", "PREVENT (FROM)", "CHECK" OR use patterns like: "PROVIDE <x> WITH THE ABILITY TO <verb> or <process_verb>" and "BE ABLE TO <process verb>."
        6. Source State (Optional):	Specifies the source of the action or process, it is defined as "FROM <y>" here y is source state
        7. Target State (Optional):	Specifies the target of the action or process, it is defined as "TO <z>" here Z is source state
        8. Attribute of object that define attributes of the object: like engaged, current, invalid
        9. object: This could be any variable or component containing articles like "A", "AN", "THE", "OF", "BY USING", "FROM", "FOR", 'IN', 'AGAINST', 'TO', 'WITH', 'EXCEPT FOR', "WHICH", "THAT" 
        10. External Condition (Optional): Adds additional conditions for the requirement. It includes "IF AND ONLY IF" as starting phrase
        11. Relaxation (Optional): Specifies when the requirement no longer applies. It is defined using "UNTIL" or "WITHIN"

        only use "process verbs" mentioned above and maintain the capital lettering for words in the structure mentioned above

        you may only use these elements when creating LESS requirements and replace synonyms with these elements

generate LESS requirements from the below nlp samples. You can use the following Json formatted examples to generate the results.

[
  {
    "nlp": "While the system is in BVAD mode, it should allow the user to start the right EPU only if the left EPU is running.",
    "LESS": "WHILE bvad_mode THE system SHALL BE ABLE TO start THE right_epu IF AND ONLY IF left_epu IN is_running"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The system should allow the user to pause the left EPU while in bvad_mode if and only if the right EPU is in the stopped state.",
    "LESS": "WHILE bvad_mode THEN THE system SHALL BE ABLE TO pause THE left_epu IF AND ONLY IF right_epu IN is_stopped STATE"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "In the clinical UI, switching from manual mode to auto mode should be possbible only if the user is logged in.",
    "LESS": "THE clinical_ui SHALL BE ABLE TO SWITCH FROM manual_mode TO auto_mode IF AND ONLY IF user IN logged_in"

  {
    "nlp": "Before engaging the manual mode, the user should be able to adjust the default systolic pressure.",
    "LESS": "BEFORE manual_mode IS engaged THE user SHALL BE ABLE TO adjust THE default_systolic_pressure."
  },
  {

    "nlp": "The user should be able to check the current diastolic pressure of the sytem if it switches from the manual mode to the auto mode.",

Now, convert the following natural language requirement into a LESS requirement:

[
  {
    "nlp": "If the system state changes from manual mode to auto mode, the user must be able to check the current systolic pressure."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The user must be able to alter the current systolic pressure when system state changes from manual mode to auto mode."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The user must be able to adjust the current systolic pressure if system state changes from manual mode to auto mode"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the system switches from manual mode to auto mode, the user should be able to adjust the current systolic pressure."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the compact drive first switches from auto mode to manual mode, the system should provide default values for pressure_parameters with the ability to confirm."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The system should provide last_values manual mode with the ability to confirm if the compact drive was operated from auto mode to manual mode."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The clinical user interface should display the description of auto mode if auto mode is selected."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The clinical user interface should provide the ability to switch from manual mode to auto mode if and only if the user is logged in."
