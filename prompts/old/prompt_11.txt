Your task is to convert natural language requirements into LESS requirements. LESS is a controlled natural language that has following format:

[Conditional][Object Attributes][Subject][Obligation][System Activity][Objects][External Condition][Relaxation]. 
You may use the following to create the complete sentence. The final LESS sentence must strictly follow these rules:

1. [Conditional] (optional):
   - Starting Keywords: "IF", "IF NOT", "WHILE", "DURING", "AFTER", "BEFORE", "AS SOON AS", "IN CASE OF".
   - Followed By (choose one):
     a) boolean_state_expression: one or more [Variables] or [Components] (concatenated with "AND") followed by "IN" and a [States] value.
     b) behavior_description: may start with a transitional like "FROM" [States] "TO" [States] or [Variables] or [Components], or [States], or a boolean_math_expression (a [Variables] followed by "LESS THAN", "GREATER THAN", or "EQUAL TO" ending with an integer or another [Variables]) or [Errors] and may be followed by "WAS" or "IS" and then [ObjectAttribute].  
   - Multiple conditionals can be concatenated with "AND". The clause may optionally end with "THEN".

2. [ObjectAttribute] (optional):
   - Describe attributes of the subject using terms from [ObjectAttribute].

3. [Subject] (mandatory):
   - Specify the subject the requirement applies to. 
   - Starting phrases: "THE", "ANY", "ALL", "SOME", or "SOME SYSTEMS OF THE"
   - followed by a subject chosen from [Components], [Variables], or [Error].
   - Optionally may be followed by connectors like "OF", "BY USING", "FROM", "FOR", "IN", "AGAINST", "TO", "WITH", "EXCEPT FOR", "WHICH", or "THAT", ending with a [Verbs].

4. [Obligation] (mandatory):
   - Use the modal verbs "SHALL" or "SHALL NOT" to define the obligation for subject.

5. [System Activity] (optional):
   - May be expressed as (choose one):
     a) provide_activity: start with "PROVIDE" followed by a [Variables] or [Components], then "WITH THE ABILITY TO" or "TO", followed by a process_verb. Multiple [Components] or [Variables] may be concatenated with "AND"
     b) be_able_activity: starts with "BE ABLE TO" followed by a process_verb.
     c) process_verbs directly.  
   - Allowed process_verbs (in uppercase): "ENSURE", "DETECT", "SWITCH", "ALLOW", "PREVENT", "PREVENT FROM", "CHECK", or a [Verbs] from the [Verbs] list (in lowercase). Multiple process_verbs can be concatenated with "AND"  
   - Each system activity can optionally include transitions like "FROM" [Components] or [Variables] "TO" [Components] or [Variables].
   - Multiple [System Activity] can be joined with "AND" 
   
6.  [ObjectAttribute] (optional):
   - Describe attributes of the subject using terms from [ObjectAttribute].

7. Object (optional):
   - Describes the target object. This can be unspecific_object or specific_object or all_object or each object.
   - begin with "THE", "ANY", "A", "AN", "ALL THE", or "EACH" followed by an object which can be any string or a [Components], [Variables], or [Error].  
   -  these optionally then be followed by phrases like "OF", "BY USING", "FROM", "FOR", "IN", "AGAINST", "TO", "WITH", "EXCEPT FOR", "WHICH", "THAT", and end with a [Verbs].

8. External Condition (optional):
   - Adds additional conditions at the end of the requirement
   - it starts with "IF AND ONLY IF" or "IF AND ONLY IF NOT" 
   - This is followed by either
	a) a boolean_state_expression: contain [Variables] or [Components] that can be concatenated with "AND" then followed by IN [States] 
	b) a behaviour_description: can begin with transitional FROM [States] and TO [States] or can begin with [Variables] or a [Components] or [States] or a boolean_math_expression or [Errors] and optionally followed by "WAS" or "IS"  followed by [ObjectAttribute]. 
   - Multiple behaviour_description can be concatenated with AND. 
   - The boolean_math_expression are [Variables] followed by a "LESS THAN", "GREATER THAN" or "EQUAL TO" and end with an integer or another [Variables]. 
   - External Condition is always before [Relaxes].

9. Relaxes (optional):
   - Specifies when the requirement no longer applies. 
   - It starts with "UNTIL" followed by any string or "WITHIN" followed by time_interval (integer followed by time measurement unit) 
   - Relaxes always appears at the end.

Use only the following controlled vocabulary. If synonyms appear, replace them with the corresponding term exactly as written:

- [Variables]: systolic_pressure, diastolic_pressure, default_systolic_pressure, default_diastolic_pressure, diastolic_pressure_limit, start_test, pumps, message, description, compact_drive_first_switch, combination, last_values, ability, default_values_for_pressure_parameters, last_values_manual_mode, openenings_number, temperature_value_of_the_flow_sensors, temperature_of_compact_drive, acoustic_alarm, information_signal
- [Verbs]: start, pause, adjust, inform, display, count, signal, emit, receive, confirm, store, indicate, cancel
- [Errors]: s4_error, s8_error, T3_alarm, s7_error, T2_alarm
- [Components]: compact_drive, user, clinical_ui, left_epu, right_epu, compact_drive_software, air_mass_balancing_valve, cannulae, system, power_supply_unit
- [ObjectAttribute]: engaged, current, invalid, selected, operated
- [States]: is_running, is_stopped, bvad_mode, lvad_mode, rvad_mode, logged_in, manual_mode, auto_mode, failed, setting, not_recomended_in_pcm, authorized, unauthorized, removed, active

Formatting rules:
- All process_verbs (e.g., SWITCH, CHECK) must be uppercase.
- All [Verbs] and controlled vocabulary terms must remain in lowercase.
- The output must be a JSON array of objects, each with keys "nlp" (the original natural language requirement) and "LESS" (the converted requirement).
- Do not include any extra text, commentary, or notes; output only valid JSON.
- Important: Do not include any additional text or notes outside of the JSON output. Do not add any notes or any additional text other than json putput:

You can use the following Json formatted examples to generate the results. 
[
  {
    "nlp": "While the system is in bvad mode, it should allow the user to start the right EPU only if the left EPU is running.",
    "LESS": "WHILE bvad_mode THE system SHALL BE ABLE TO start THE right_epu IF AND ONLY IF left_epu IN is_running"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "In the clinical UI, switching from manual mode to auto mode should be possible only if the user is logged in.",
    "LESS": "THE clinical_ui SHALL BE ABLE TO SWITCH FROM manual_mode TO auto_mode IF AND ONLY IF user IN logged_in"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The user should be able to modify the default systolic pressure before engaging the manual mode ",
    "LESS": "BEFORE manual_mode IS engaged THE user SHALL BE ABLE TO adjust THE default_systolic_pressure."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the system switches from manual mode to auto mode, it should adjust the diastolic pressure limit within 5 minutes.",
    "LESS": "IF FROM manual_mode TO auto_mode THE system SHALL adjust THE diastolic_pressure_limit WITHIN \"5 min\""
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The user should be able to check the current diastolic pressure of the sytem if it switches from the manual mode to the auto mode.",
    "LESS": "IF FROM manual_mode TO auto_mode THE user SHALL BE ABLE TO CHECK current diastolic_pressure"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The clinical user interface should display the description of manual mode if manual mode is selected.",
    "LESS": "IF manual_mode IS selected THE clinical_ui SHALL display THE description OF manual_mode"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the bvad mode is in failed state and the right epu fails, the compact drive has to signal an S8 error.",
    "LESS": "IF bvad_mode AND right_epu IN failed STATE THE compact_drive SHALL signal A s8_error"
  }
]


Now, convert the following natural language requirement into a LESS requirement:

    "nlp": " The system should allow the user to pause the left epu while in bvad_mode if and only if the right EPU is in the stopped state."
  },

  },
  {
    "nlp": "The user must be able to alter the current systolic pressure when system state changes from manual mode to auto mode."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The user must be able to adjust the current systolic pressure if system state changes from manual mode to auto mode"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the system switches from manual mode to auto mode, the user should be able to adjust the current systolic pressure."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the compact drive first switches from auto mode to manual mode, the system should provide default values for pressure parameters with the ability to confirm."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The system should provide last values manual mode with the ability to confirm if the compact drive was operated from auto mode to manual mode."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The clinical user interface should display the description of auto mode if auto mode is selected."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The clinical user interface should provide the ability to switch from manual mode to auto mode only if the user is logged in."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The clinical user interface should allow to switch from auto mode to manual mode if and only if the user is logged in."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The openenings number of the air mass balancing valve should be stored by the compact drive."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The compact drive should count the openenings number of the air mass balancing valve."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "the compact drive software should signal an S4 type error if the start test fails"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the bvad mode and the left epu are in failed state the compact drive should signal an S8 type error."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the lvad mode and the right epu fails, the compact drive software should immediately signal an S4 type error."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the lvad mode is in failed state and the left epu also fails, the compact drive software should signal an S4 error."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The compact drive software should signal an S4 type error if the rvad mode and the right epu are in failed state."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The compact drive software should signal an S4 error if the rvad mode is in failed state and the left epu fails."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If both pumps and cannulae are in setting, and the combination is not recommended in PCM, the user should receive a message."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the power supply unit is removed and the acoustic alarm is not active, the compact drive should emit an information signal."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the temperature of the compact drive is invalid, the compact drive software should signal a T3 alarm."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "The compact drive software should signal a T3 alarm if the temperature of the compact drive is less than 5 C"
  },
  {
    "nlp": "After the temperature of the compact drive drops below 60 C and the T2 alarm is active, the compact drive software should cancel the T2 alarm."
  },
  {
    "nlp": "If the temperature value of the flow sensors is not valid, the compact drive shall indicate an S7 error."
  }
